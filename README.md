SetUp
------
This project is built with ADT using the Android library concept for dependency management.
First, clone this repository. You will also need clones of my [Utils-HoloEverwhere][3] and [Utils-ActionBarSherlock][4] forks.
See the project.properties files on how they depend on one another. To sucessfully build you should add the correct Content Provider URI in the strings.xml file (I am working on building a re usable API for this).
